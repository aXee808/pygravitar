# PyGravitar (Atari vector game clone)

PyGravitar is a little project to learn pygame library basics.
Game is still in progress and some games mechanics aren't coded.
I have to implement somes features :
- collision tests (bullets & ship) with ground
- refueling process
- highscores

Some technical improvement are also required :
- resolve bullet bugs and collision 
- 3D vectors (actually i'm using 2D vectors) to manage scale display

I plan to experiment deep reinforcement learning with this game environnement.

## Installation

Clone this github repository on local computer, create virtual environment (with conda or virtualenv).
Activate virtual environment and install required libraries :

```bash
pip install - r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
